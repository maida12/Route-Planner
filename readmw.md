Implement Route Planner for RESCUE 1122 using A* search algorithm. You are required to design
the complete system as (SIMULATION) for Route planning for optimal path to reach the accident site
(Shortest-distance finding problem). You can use any tool for its implementation. You can use google maps as
well. You can use bit-map method for simulation by using (40 x 40) and (60 x 60) grid and use cells as 2D
locations e.g., start-state (2, 3) to destination (38, 39) with obstacles and roads infra-structure as well. First,
map your problem and then propose solution. You can use case study of Rescue 1122 ambulance service in
Lahore and design an optimized scheduling system. It will be a simulation and modeling project in
programming. (20 marks)
c. Implement Evolutionary Search (Genetic Algorithm) for the above problem and compare the
optimized route generated by GA with the route generated by A* search algorithm. (20 marks)
Q2. Comparative analysis of features/functions of 4-5 commercial tools/applications for route planning
available in different parts of the world e.g., USA, UK, Europe, UAE, etc. For example: www.mapquest.com
and WAZE https://www.waze.com/livemap https://developers.google.com/waze/, THEAA, RAC, TomTom,
Green Flag, etc. Propose some modifications or innovation in these route planners for Pakistani environment.
Can we incorporate some extra services like blood donation, ride sharing, security, smart and secure tourism,
restaurant recommendation system within main car navigation system, etc. What are the requirements for such
systems from the AI perspective.
